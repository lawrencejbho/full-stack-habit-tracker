# Habit Tracker #



### Changelog: ###
  - added in the ability to use onMouseOver on the + symbol so that it'll select the currentHabitID and then it will increment the specific counter on Click
  - previously had a problem when trying to run both functions at the same time where the first click wouldn't increment the counter but would just change the currentHabitId
  - Input button's text now gets saved to the body of the object and is also stored in localStorage
  - Added in the background image, plus and minus icons, minusCounter function
