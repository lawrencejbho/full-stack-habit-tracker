# Habit Tracker








Things I don't understand:
- when using onMouseOver, I need to return a function versus passing the function directly 









Changelog:
- added in the ability to use onMouseOver on the + symbol so that it'll select the currentHabitID and then it will increment the specific counter on Click
  - previously had a problem when trying to run both functions at the same time where the first click wouldn't increment the counter but would just change the currentHabitId





To do:
- need to make it so that the body that is typed in the input will be put as the body in the new habit
