## Technologies

Habby was built using a MongoDB database with Express.js for the backend.  API requests using Axios were used to communicate with the backend and all responses render JSON back to the frontend which uses React.  React sets up the frontend state such that components are updated in a simple and controlled manner leading to a better UX design.
